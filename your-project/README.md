## Project Description
Seeing the amount of students with driver licenses and that holidays are pretty close, we wanted to check how dangerous is drive in Barcelona on those days.

The goal of our project was find insights to share with the rest of the class with the aim of keeping everyone safe.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The questions that we want to answer are the following ones:
  * How dangerous is driving in Barcelona?
  * Where are those accidents mostly located?
  * When do more accidents occur?
  * Which is the most dangerous holiday?
Before we started checking the data, we thought that Barcelona was more dangerous on holidays, specially in the night. Shall we were correct?
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?

## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
