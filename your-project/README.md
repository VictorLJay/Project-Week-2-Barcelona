## Project Description


## Questions & Hypotheses
The questions that we want to answer are the following ones:
  * 
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?

## Dataset
The dataset that we used was the original contained on the folder, the **accidents-2017.csv**. From that data, we isolated part of it in different CSV files mentioned above.

## Database
The structure of our database follows the same structure for both tables created, named **acc-with-hol.csv** and **acc-without-hol.csv**. The structure is the following:
  * District Name
  * Weekday
  * Month
  * Day
  * Part of the day
  * Mild injuries
  * Serious injuries
  * Victims
  * Vehicles Involved
  * Date

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
